As I've furthened my understanding of mathematics, I've eventually run into topics and concepts that make it difficult to grasp what, exactly, mathematics is talking about. Inevitably when it comes to studying mathematics we encounter concepts that are difficult to conceive or seem outright contradictory with our notions about the world. This is a common difficulty I'm sure many have encountered.

#### Counting

Mathematics education begins, as children, with simple counting (addition). Counting is the root of all mathematics. We start by learning to count, one by one. Then we learn to add, which is effectively learning shortcuts to skip ahead when counting: I can do $$ 2 + 2 = 4 $$ without having to go "one, two, and then, three and four". With repeated addition we get multiplication. With repeated multiplication we get powers. And so forth.

As we learn to count we develp an intuition for math. If I promise you a cookie, and I promess you another cookie, the intuition that you now will have two cookies and that two cookies is more (and better, if you like cookies) than one cookie seems self-evident. We learm to write this as $$ 1 + 1 = 2 $$ and don't think much of it. 

#### Failures of intuition, to infinity and beyond

Yet behind this simplicity is hidden a deeper question: mathematics does not concern itself with defining what we mean by "cookie". *True* mathematics only deals with abstract quantities, stripped from anchors to real world objects, which suggests a first hint that, perhaps, what seems so intuitive isn't so intuitive after all. 

It's easy to visualize what one cookie represents. But what about visualizing what "one" means? When we add one to another one, then another, and so forth, and keep going until we proclaim this goes on forever, to infinity, how exactly do we develop an intuition for infinity? 

Infinity was already a hard enough concept to grasp, and then mathematician George Cantor showed up in {year} and satisfyingly showed - through mathematical deduction - that some infinites are, in fact, bigger than some other infinites. There are more real numbers than there are natural numbers, even though both are infinite. What? Suddenly, visualization and intuition fail. What does this even mean? 

What is mathematics even talking *about*?

#### Plato's metaphysics

Plato's belief was that numbers actually *existed* somewhere, independently of us, our language, our thoughts, our cultures, in a metaphysical realm. For Plato, $$ 1 + 1 = 2 $$ is an actual  *thing* that exists, and we are merely explorers stumbling into all the neat little mathematical rules that the universe has laid out for us. Whence we all cease to exist, $$ 1 + 1 = 2 $$ will still be kicking around, doing its thing.

It's a view that feels somewhat mystical or even quasi-religious, produces suitably awe-inspiring quotes ("mathematics is part of the fabric of the universe!"), yet seems to add a layer of *something* that doesn't, in the end, really explain anything new.

An alternate view from Plato's is that mathematics is nothing more than a set of elaborate mind games that humans *invented*. Pick a small set of axioms, infer everything that derives from those axioms and *voil√†*, you have some mathematics. Because humans live in this universe, we will be inclined to pick axioms that match behaviors seen in our universe - or that seem the most useful. If I'm trading three sheep for your seven goats I need a way to know if I'm getting a good deal, so I'm going to invent ways to count sheep and goats. In this scenario, the mathematical rules can be used to approximately (emphasis on *proxy* here) decribe the universe. But they're not *embedded* in it. They're not a thing.

I'm a proponent of the latter perspective. More on this below.

#### More of the same

To understand the idea of one, or two, or three, one must be able to understand the concept of objects that are the same, or that are similar. You can have one cookie, or two cookies - but the cookies are in your mind. 

Nature doesn't have a neat delineation for what a cookie is - or anything else for that matter. It's just a blobby pile of delicious dough. Is it a cookie if it's not baked? Most likely. If you split the cookie in two, you now have two halves of an (unbaked) cookie. Or do you? You reshape the halves, make them circular again. Now you have two cookies.

Counting is pattern matching. Counting is classification. Without either there is nothing to count. Counting is slicing the universe into parts that seem related or the same and keeping tracks of those parts. We only need to count and add because we intuitively *divided* in the first place.

In short, *mathematics* is a mental construct. When one learns of the concept of infinity it's natural to try to apply it to the notion of our universe. When thinking of infinities of different sizes we might clumsily think of our infinite universe somehow jammed inside an *even bigger* infinite universe. Mind blown!

Yet there is not necessarily a need to develop an intuition for what infinity is, or what infinities of different sizes might mean intuitively, because we don't have any proof that infinities of any size exist in our universe. The infinitely small may not exist either. Mathematics offers a model and a set of rules for *how things would work* if such things exist, but such doesn't guarantee that the real universe makes use of every concept in mathematics.

#### The qualia of one

I can think of the color blue. I know an object is blue when I see it. Blue could be defined as the frequencies roughly betweeen {x-y} in the spectral frequency range - but that range only matters because it has been singled out by the human experience. *Blue* is purely seen from a human viewpoint. We could have instead assigned the word *blue* to the temperature range between 10 and 11 degrees celsius. Or to a speed of about 5 miles per hour. But we did no such thing, because we are not equipped with senses accurate enough to distinguish temperatures and speeds as we do with hues. 

In fact, some humans have never seen, and never will, see the color blue, and it's safe to say if the world was populated solely with such humans, blue would not enter human consciousness at all. Without the human experience, blue is an arbitrarily defined, non-d

What if "one" could be considered the same?

That doesn't mean "blue" is an item in a metaphysical universe.
